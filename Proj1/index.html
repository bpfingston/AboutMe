          <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>My name is Bryce Pfingston, after studying for 2 years to obtain an Associates degree in Psychology, I realized I was unsure of what I wanted from a career.  I decided to work full-time, earn money and see what I could pursue. I worked a series of jobs - managing a restaurant, managing a hookah shop, working for TSA at the airport. Unfortunately, nothing ever felt fulfilling, or really mentally stimulating. My mum (who leads engineering teams) recommended a python class – she and my brother had thought I’d like programming, and to my surprise I liked it. I decided to take a few more classes, including some intro classes/front end design classes in CSS and HTML. Realizing that I enjoyed it and could make a career of it, I looked for a bootcamp and researched the top 4-5. I signed up for App Academy’s prep bootcamp and really enjoyed the material, the process and the challenges, and then came to Codefellows to follow my new found sense of what I wanted to do with my life. </p>
